>>This run is identical to e7 run, but with an additional wind forcing.

>>The wind forcing gen file and the bin file itself can be found in e10. 
They are identical. 

>>Run file 'gen-wind-forcing.py' and it will output 
'merid_wind_forcing.bin'. Add this to input/data near the end as the
meridWindFile and bing bang boom.

>>To summarize:
e7: N/f = 5, no wind
e8: N/f = 20, no wind
e9: N/f = 5, wind
e10: N/f = 20, wind
